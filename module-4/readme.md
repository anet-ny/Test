# AI for imaging
## About
In this module, participants will learn how to process and generate images with deep learning and convolutional neural networks.

Graduates will:

    get an overview of Machine Learning to generate images
    use online tools to generate and train generative image and video models
    learn about the ethical issues around the use of data for model training
    get a technical insight into the architecture of Deep Learnning models
    learn how to handle image generation and processing via code
    learn about classical algorithmic image generation
