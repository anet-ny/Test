#AI and ML Fundamentals 
##about
in this module we approach basic AI concepts from an historical, cultural, aesthetic, and technical point of view to perform machine learning.

Graduates will:

    build up a general understanding of AI
    be introduced to historical background of AI
    be introduced to larger concpetual debates around AI in science, art, politics, and the industry
    survey creative uses of AI in the arts historically and in the present
    know basic concepts of machine learning: training, testing, over- and underfitting, performance measures
