# AI for Natural Language
## About
In this module, participants will study how to train deep neural networks to learn and generate data from movement and vice versa. Real time interactions and the loops thereby generated will also be considered.
Graduates will:

    know common applications and platforms for AI movement analysis and generation
    be introduced to various types of sensors for capturing movement
    record and collect movement data
    know human and machine understandable representations of movement data
    train deep neural networs with movement data

## Module Assessment

For this module

- you can either write an essay or review on something related to AI for movement, the essay should be 3-5 A4 pages with font size 11 and 1.5 interlinar distance

- or do a small project in which you use the tools presented in class.

You are encouraged to work in teams, and each participant should invest about 30 hours effort. The deadline will be defined in class.
